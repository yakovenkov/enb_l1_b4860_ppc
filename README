OVERVIEW

This is quite simple but almost working LTE L1 implementation for the famous NXP's B4860 SoC.

It successfully runs on top of B4860QDS board and other B4860-based modules with commercial RRU
connected via CPRI link (YD/T 2731-2014 and newer).

This repository contains PowerPC side of IPC/FAPI implementation, RRU control and simple FAPI 
generator used for development and testing.

BUILD

Build requirements:

1. Firmware binary for SC3900FP
2. QorIQ SDK for PowerPC (ver 1.7 or higher)
3. PowerPC Linux kernel with PREEMPT_RT patch applied

Build process:

1. Build kernel modules located in b4860/libb4860/kernel
2. Use standard CMake build flow

   CMake options:
     ENABLE_L2_FAPI_GEN_4G - enable build of FAPI generator
     ENABLE_B4860_DIRECT_LOG - use direct logging from SC3900FP
     ENABLE_CPRI_ETH_FDD - use FDD RRU (YD/T 2731-2014/FDD compliant)
   
   Available targets:
     dsp_bt - DSP boot utility, used to load DSP image to SC3900FP cores
     fapi_b4860_v1 - FAPI and IPC library for PowerPC side
     l2_fapi_generator_dl - FAPI generator

After successfull build, copy binaries to B4860, use scripts/init.sh to load modules and 
setup TAP interface to communicate the RRU over CPRI link.

Note, IPC implementation used here is quite differs from original Freescale's one and 
isn't compatible with it.
