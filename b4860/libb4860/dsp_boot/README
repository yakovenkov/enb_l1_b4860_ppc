DSP Boot
-------

Usage
$dsp_bt <dsp image file>

DSP boot application does the following
(a) Checks if the DSP_READY is set
(b) Parses the DSP binary file and loads into M2/DDR
(c) Sets PPC Ready so that the DSP image executes
(d) waits for HW semaphore 0 to be set to the value 0xfe
(e) Clear the hw semaphore 0


Dependencies
- linux Heterogeneous manager driver 
- linux IPC driver 
both should be up before executing this application.
- Linux Hugetlbfs subsystem


DSP behaviour
1. DSP after setting HW semaphore1, sends a MSG on Channel 0 to
indicate that the DSP IPC is up. It then waits for further actions
from Linux Side.


Internals
1. DSP Boot Application uses shamget to create a hugetlb of 16MB.
Out of this area the pa_shared_area and dsp_shared_area is allocated.
This is set in the shared control area structure before DSP is booted up.
2. The shared memory ID is saved with the Heterogeneous manager, which can 
later be retrieved by any other application which wants to work on the
same shared area.
